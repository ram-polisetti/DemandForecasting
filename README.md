# Demand Forecasting
## Scenario

## Role to simulate - Operations/ Supply Chain Analyst
A home improvement and a DIY distributor with demand history for multiple product lines needs a demand forecast for the next forecasting period.

As an internal operations/ Supply chain analyst, I will use ARIMA forecasting to create demand forecast models, evaluate the model accuracy and goodness of fit, predict future and evaluate forecast statistics.
